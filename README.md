# php-uploader
mainly to upload images

will upload files to a /uploads/ subdirectory so create one.

## issues:
1, paste from clipboard is fail, 1st attempts to get bot to fix it was all kinds of fail
2, "copy link" link doesn't have the correct URL
3, file expiration not functional AFAIKRN but an option i'd like to have
4, security: you will probably want to lock this down via .htaccess
